    <h1>Internet Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Unordered List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item and its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in particular order</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ordered List</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Notice "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increments on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <h3>Put attention italic</h3>
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <h3>Put attention strong</h3>
    <p>Other time you need to <stong>strong</stong>ly emphasize the importance of a words</p>
