    <h1>Internet Is Easy!</h1>
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Unordered List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Add "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item and its own "li" element</li>
        <li>They don't need to be in particular order</li>
    </ul>
